# 0x08-recursion
This directory is a collection of C programs that focus on the concept of recursion. Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. This directory contains various functions implemented using recursion, covering topics such as printing strings, calculating factorials, computing the Fibonacci series, and more. Each program demonstrates the use of recursion to solve specific tasks and provides a deeper understanding of this fundamental programming technique.
